            <p><span data-actor="Francisco">Francisco: For this relief much thanks: 'tis bitter cold,

                If you do meet Horatio and Marcellus,
                The rivals of my watch, bid them make haste.</span></p>
            <p><span data-actor="Francisco">Francisco: I think I hear them. Stand, ho! Who's there?
                Enter HORATIO and MARCELLUS</span></p>

            <p><span data-actor="Horatio">Horatio: Friends to this ground.</span></p>
            

            <p><span data-actor="Marcellus">Marcellus: And liegemen to the Dane.</span></p>

                Give you good night.

                What, is Horatio there?</span></p>
            <p><span data-actor="Horatio">Horatio: A piece of him.</span></p>

            <p><span data-actor="Marcellus">Marcellus: What, has this thing appear'd again to-night?</span></p>
            <p><span data-actor="Bernardo">Bernardo: I have seen nothing.</span></p>
            <p><span data-actor="Marcellus">Marcellus: Horatio says 'tis but our fantasy,
                And will not let belief take hold of him
                Touching this dreaded sight, twice seen of us:
                Therefore I have entreated him along
                With us to watch the minutes of this night;
                That if again this apparition come,
                He may approve our eyes and speak to it.</span></p>
            <p><span data-actor="Horatio">Horatio: Tush, tush, 'twill not appear.</span></p>
            <p><span data-actor="Bernardo">Bernardo: Sit down awhile;
                And let us once again assail your ears,
                That are so fortified against our story
                What we have two nights seen.</span></p>
            <p><span data-actor="Horatio">Horatio: Well, sit we down,
                And let us hear Bernardo speak of this.</span></p>
            <p><span data-actor="Bernardo">Bernardo: Last night of all,
                When yond same star that's westward from the pole
                Had made his course to illume that part of heaven
                Where now it burns, Marcellus and myself,
                The bell then beating one,--
                Enter Ghost</span></p>
            <p><span data-actor="Marcellus">Marcellus: Peace, break thee off; look, where it comes again!</span></p>
            <p><span data-actor="Bernardo">Bernardo: In the same figure, like the king that's dead.</span></p>    
            <p><span data-actor="Marcellus">Marcellus: Thou art a scholar; speak to it, Horatio.</span></p>
            <p><span data-actor="Bernardo">Bernardo: Looks it not like the king? mark it, Horatio.</span></p>
            <p><span data-actor="Horatio">Horatio: Most like: it harrows me with fear and wonder.</span></p>
            <p><span data-actor="Bernardo">Bernardo: It would be spoke to.</span></p>
            <p><span data-actor="Marcellus">Marcellus: Question it, Horatio.</span></p>
            <p><span data-actor="Horatio">Horatio: What art thou that usurp'st this time of night,
                Together with that fair and warlike form
                In which the majesty of buried Denmark
                Did sometimes march? by heaven I charge thee, speak!</span></p>
            <p><span data-actor="Marcellus">Marcellus: It is offended.</span></p>
            <p><span data-actor="Bernardo">Bernardo: See, it stalks away!</span></p>
            <p><span data-actor="Horatio">Horatio: Stay! speak, speak! I charge thee, speak!
                Exit Ghost</span></p>
            <p><span data-actor="Marcellus">Marcellus: 'Tis gone, and will not answer.</span></p>
            <p><span data-actor="Bernardo">Bernardo: How now, Horatio! you tremble and look pale:
                Is not this something more than fantasy?
                What think you on't?</span></p>
            <p><span data-actor="Horatio">Horatio: Before my God, I might not this believe
                Without the sensible and true avouch
                Of mine own eyes.</span></p>
            <p><span data-actor="Marcellus">Marcellus: Is it not like the king?</span></p>
            <p><span data-actor="Horatio">Horatio: As thou art to thyself:
                Such was the very armour he had on
                When he the ambitious Norway combated;
                So frown'd he once, when, in an angry parle,
                He smote the sledded Polacks on the ice.
                'Tis strange.</span></p>
            <p><span data-actor="Marcellus">Marcellus: Thus twice before, and jump at this dead hour,
                With martial stalk hath he gone by our watch.</span></p>
            <p><span data-actor="Horatio">Horatio: In what particular thought to work I know not;
                But in the gross and scope of my opinion,
                This bodes some strange eruption to our state.</span></p>
            <p><span data-actor="Marcellus">Marcellus: Good now, sit down, and tell me, he that knows,
                Why this same strict and most observant watch
                So nightly toils the subject of the land,
                And why such daily cast of brazen cannon,
                And foreign mart for implements of war;
                Why such impress of shipwrights, whose sore task
                Does not divide the Sunday from the week;
                What might be toward, that this sweaty haste
                Doth make the night joint-labourer with the day:
                Who is't that can inform me?</span></p>
            <p><span data-actor="Horatio">Horatio: That can I;
                At least, the whisper goes so. Our last king,
                Whose image even but now appear'd to us,
                Was, as you know, by Fortinbras of Norway,
                Thereto prick'd on by a most emulate pride,
                Dared to the combat; in which our valiant Hamlet--
                For so this side of our known world esteem'd him--
                Did slay this Fortinbras; who by a seal'd compact,
                Well ratified by law and heraldry,
                Did forfeit, with his life, all those his lands
                Which he stood seized of, to the conqueror:
                Against the which, a moiety competent
                Was gaged by our king; which had return'd
                To the inheritance of Fortinbras,
                Had he been vanquisher; as, by the same covenant,
                And carriage of the article design'd,
                His fell to Hamlet. Now, sir, young Fortinbras,
                Of unimproved mettle hot and full,
                Hath in the skirts of Norway here and there
                Shark'd up a list of lawless resolutes,
                For food and diet, to some enterprise
                That hath a stomach in't; which is no other--
                As it doth well appear unto our state--
                But to recover of us, by strong hand
                And terms compulsatory, those foresaid lands
                So by his father lost: and this, I take it,
                Is the main motive of our preparations,
                The source of this our watch and the chief head
                Of this post-haste and romage in the land.</span></p>
            <p><span data-actor="Bernardo">Bernardo: I think it be no other but e'en so:
                Well may it sort that this portentous figure
                Comes armed through our watch; so like the king
                That was and is the question of these wars.</span></p>
            <p><span data-actor="Horatio">Horatio: A mote it is to trouble the mind's eye.
                In the most high and palmy state of Rome,
                A little ere the mightiest Julius fell,
                The graves stood tenantless and the sheeted dead
                Did squeak and gibber in the Roman streets:
                As stars with trains of fire and dews of blood,
                Disasters in the sun; and the moist star
                Upon whose influence Neptune's empire stands
                Was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse:
                And even the like precurse of fierce events,
                As harbingers preceding still the fates
                And prologue to the omen coming on,
                Have heaven and earth together demonstrated
                Unto our climatures and countrymen.--
                But soft, behold! lo, where it comes again!
                Re-enter Ghost
                
                I'll cross it, though it blast me. Stay, illusion!
                If thou hast any sound, or use of voice,
                Speak to me:
                If there be any good thing to be done,
                That may to thee do ease and grace to me,
                Speak to me:
                Cock crows
                
                If thou art privy to thy country's fate,
                Which, happily, foreknowing may avoid, O, speak!
                Or if thou hast uphoarded in thy life
                Extorted treasure in the womb of earth,
                For which, they say, you spirits oft walk in death,
                Speak of it: stay, and speak! Stop it, Marcellus.</span></p>
            <p><span data-actor="Marcellus">Marcellus: Shall I strike at it with my partisan?</span></p>
            <p><span data-actor="Horatio">Horatio: Do, if it will not stand.</span></p>
            <p><span data-actor="Bernardo">Bernardo: 'Tis here!</span></p>
            <p><span data-actor="Horatio">Horatio: 'Tis here!</span></p>
            <p><span data-actor="Marcellus">Marcellus: 'Tis gone!
                Exit Ghost
                
                We do it wrong, being so majestical,
                To offer it the show of violence;
                For it is, as the air, invulnerable,
                And our vain blows malicious mockery.</span></p>
            <p><span data-actor="Bernardo">Bernardo: It was about to speak, when the cock crew.</span></p>
            <p><span data-actor="Horatio">Horatio: And then it started like a guilty thing
                Upon a fearful summons. I have heard,
                The cock, that is the trumpet to the morn,
                Doth with his lofty and shrill-sounding throat
                Awake the god of day; and, at his warning,
                Whether in sea or fire, in earth or air,
                The extravagant and erring spirit hies
                To his confine: and of the truth herein
                This present object made probation.</span></p>
            <p><span data-actor="Marcellus">Marcellus: It faded on the crowing of the cock.
                Some say that ever 'gainst that season comes
                Wherein our Saviour's birth is celebrated,
                The bird of dawning singeth all night long:
                And then, they say, no spirit dares stir abroad;
                The nights are wholesome; then no planets strike,
                No fairy takes, nor witch hath power to charm,
                So hallow'd and so gracious is the time.</span></p>
            <p><span data-actor="Horatio">Horatio: So have I heard and do in part believe it.
                But, look, the morn, in russet mantle clad,
                Walks o'er the dew of yon high eastward hill:
                Break we our watch up; and by my advice,
                Let us impart what we have seen to-night
                Unto young Hamlet; for, upon my life,
                This spirit, dumb to us, will speak to him.
                Do you consent we shall acquaint him with it,
                As needful in our loves, fitting our duty?</span></p>
            <p><span data-actor="Marcellus">Marcellus: Let's do't, I pray; and I this morning know
                Where we shall find him most conveniently.
                Exeunt</span></p>
